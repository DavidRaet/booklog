## 1. AI is your last resort, not your first stop.
If you run to AI the second you feel stuck, you’re cheating yourself out of the most valuable part of learning: struggle. You must bleed on the problem for at least 20–30 minutes before asking AI for guidance. If you skip this, you are not learning — you’re outsourcing your brain.

## 2. Never copy-paste code blindly.
Every single line AI gives you must be rewritten, refactored, or annotated by you. If you don’t understand the code deeply enough to explain it in a technical interview, it doesn’t belong in your project. If you paste blindly, you’re just building projects that look like yours but aren’t.

## 3. AI is a sparring partner, not a babysitter.
AI exists to question you, push back, and expose your weak points — not to do your homework. If you only use it to solve problems instead of to interrogate your thinking, you’re weakening your own critical faculties. Treat it like a rival, not a savior.

## 4. Human feedback is non-negotiable.
Stakeholder demos, collaboration, teamwork dynamics — these are human experiences AI cannot replicate. If you try to replace human feedback with AI roleplay, you’re lying to yourself about what “real software engineering” looks like. Show your work to peers, mentors, or even non-tech friends. If you dodge this, you’re avoiding reality.

## 5. Own your mistakes — AI is not your scapegoat.
If AI misleads you, that’s still your fault for not verifying. The code, the bugs, the design decisions — they’re all yours to defend. In the real world, no one cares if “the AI suggested it.” Your independence depends on taking full responsibility for everything you ship.
